# 82ndrop Master Prompt Template Implementation

## Summary

Implemented Jeff GPT's directive to make vertical video generation the **default behavior** for all 82ndrop video prompts using the Master Prompt Template strategy.

## What Changed (Default Behavior)

### ‚úÖ All Videos Now Generated As:

- **Vertical 9:16 format** (TikTok optimized)
- **Full composite layout** with Top Third/Center/Bottom Third structure
- **Natural language output** (not JSON)
- **Mobile-first design** for phone screens
- **Built-in captions and branding** (@82ndrop | #tiktokfilm)

### ‚úÖ Master Prompt Template Structure

```
Generate a single, cohesive vertical short-form video (9:16 aspect ratio, optimized for TikTok mobile viewing), [DURATION] seconds long. The screen is a composite of the following layers:

Top Third:
Display the static text: "[TOP_LINE]" in a [FONT_STYLE] font. This stays visible for the full duration.

Center (Main Scene):
Show [MAIN_SCENE_DESCRIPTION, including camera style, mood, and any voice-over]. Frame it vertically for mobile viewing.

Bottom Third:
Over a motion B-roll [BACKGROUND_DESCRIPTION], display the following captions:
[TIME_1]: "[CAPTION_1]"
[TIME_2]: "[CAPTION_2]"
...
Include the branding text "@82ndrop | #tiktokfilm" in the bottom third.

All visual layers should feel cinematic, coherent, and aligned with the TikTok 9:16 format.
```
