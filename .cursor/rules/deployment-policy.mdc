# Deployment Policy Rule

All deployments (production and staging) **must** be performed via GitHub Actions workflows only. Manual deployments using `make deploy`, `make deploy-gcloud`, or `make deploy-production` are **strictly prohibited** and will be considered a violation of project policy.

For more details, see [README.md](mdc:README.md) and [makefile](mdc:makefile).
